                        <p>In October 2014, Warner Bros. Pictures announced the film as "at least" a trilogy with the third instalment
                            to be released on 20 November 2020. In July 2016, director David Yates confirmed that J. K. Rowling had ideas
                            for the third film's screenplay. In October 2016, it was reported that the Fantastic Beasts film series would
                            comprise five films, and Eddie Redmayne would be returning to all films to play the lead role of Newt Scamander, 
                            with producers Rowling, David Heyman, Steve Kloves, and Lionel Wigram. In November 2016, Yates revealed that he 
                            would be directing all five films, stating "I love making films, and I've got a great team, all of whom are like family."
                            In October 2018, Johnny Depp hinted that he might return to portray Gellert Grindelwald for the third film, which would 
                            start filming in mid-2019. In November 2019, Warner Bros. put out a press release announcing the film's location of Brazil, 
                            a spring 2020 start of production, and that Steve Kloves, who had previously served as screenwriter on the Harry Potter films, 
                            had joined the project as co-writer. On 7 February 2019, it was revealed the film will be set in the 1930s, with the story leads 
                            up to the Wizarding World's involvement in World War II and will explore the magical communities in Bhutan, Germany and China in 
                            addition to previously established locations including the United States and United Kingdom.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-title-prod mt-5">Casting</h2>
                        <p>In March 2020, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Callum Turner, Katherine Waterston, and Jessica Williams 
                            were revealed to be reprising their roles from prior films, alongside Redmayne.In November 2020, Depp announced he would not reprise 
                            his role as Grindelwald after being asked by Warner Bros. to resign due to negative publicity resulting from the libel case Depp v News
                            Group Newspapers Ltd. Depp shot only one scene in London after production began in September 2020, and his contract stipulated that he would
                            be paid regardless of whether the film was completed or not. Depp's salary was reportedly somewhere between $10-$16 million. On 25 November,
                            Warner Bros. announced that Mads Mikkelsen would replace Depp in the role of Grindelwald.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-title-prod mt-5">Filming</h2>
                        <p>Principal photography was scheduled to begin on 16 March 2020 but was postponed on that very day due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming officially 
                            commenced on 20 September, with safety precautions in place to keep the cast and crew safe from COVID-19. On 3 February 2021, filming at Warner Bros. 
                            Studios, Leavesden in the UK was halted after a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. Composer James Newton Howard confirmed later that month that 
                            production had wrapped filming.</p>
