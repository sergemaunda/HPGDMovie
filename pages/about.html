                    <p>Set in the 1930s, the story leads up to the Wizarding World's involvement in World War II 
                        and will explore the magical communities in Bhutan, Germany, and China in addition to previously established 
                        locations including Brazil, the United States and United Kingdom. With Gellert Grindelwald's power rapidly 
                        growing, Albus Dumbledore entrusts Newt Scamander and his friends with a mission leading to a clash with Grindelwald's army. 
                        Dumbledore must also ponder how long he will stay on the sidelines in the approaching war.
